description: "Create XXD Panel 256 raster artwork: a faithful photograph paired with a contemporary naïve folk illustration with one centered subject, rounded forms and a large field of paper. Accepts one image or a directory batch and supports top-bottom, left-right, design-only and four-device wallpaper outputs; multiple ratios or exact sizes; prompt-generated, user-exact or text-free typography. Use whenever the user invokes xxd-panel-256 or asks for this 稚拙民艺 style."

# XXD Panel 256

Create finished PNG artwork from the current user-supplied photograph or image directory. Read `references/original-prompt/zh-CN.md` completely immediately before every generation. That Chinese source brief is the sole creative and aesthetic authority; never summarise, translate, blend, or replace it with this file, a README, a sample, or another Panel.

Read `references/soldier-runtime.md` completely immediately before building every generation request. It is the sole family runtime contract for parameters, preference reuse, directory batches, preflight, prompt assembly, bitmap execution, output isolation, and acceptance. This Skill must not write a second art direction or a second runtime.

## Panel-specific overlay

The transformed design is one illustrated moment, not a full depiction. Keep a single subject near the center as the only focus, built from simplified forms, symbolic contours and flat color. Leave a large field of paper. Edges may be irregular, with paint coverage, paper texture and hand error. Reject a complex background, several narrative elements, digital perfection and a filled page.

These overlay rules add to `references/soldier-runtime.md`. They never replace the source brief or the family runtime contract.

Write every selected final PNG directly inside one fresh task directory under `~/Desktop/xxd/xxd-panel-256/` (or the explicit `--out` root). Use collision-safe filenames; do not create source, mode, or size subdirectories and do not generate an automatic contact sheet.
